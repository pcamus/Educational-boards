## Thermostat simulation.

- [therm_loop_sim.py](therm_loop_sim.py)
- [therm_loop_sim_uti.py](therm_loop_sim_uti.py)

In this example simulation values are given one by one in the code (you need to re-run your code for each simulation).

This will be replaced with values in a list and with values extracted from a spreadsheet.

- [global_var.py](global_var.py) : is an exmaple of global variable usage.
