## Using Neopxiel

The code [neo_bar_graph.py](neo_bar_graph.py) uses one of the PIO of the Pico to generate the data bit stream to control the Neopixel bus.

A bargraph on a Adafruit 1426 8 pixels stick is used as an example. 

The code is adapted from : http://www.pibits.net/code/raspberry-pi-pico-and-neopixel-example-in-micropython.php
