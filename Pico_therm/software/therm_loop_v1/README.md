## Thermostat simulation.

- [therm_loop_v1.py](therm_loop_v1.py)
- [therm_loop_util_v1.py](therm_loop_util_v1.py)

In this example simulation values are given one by one in the code (you need to re-run your code for each simulation).

The module used to access the LCD and DS18B20 are also given and will be analysed later.
