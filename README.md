## Educational prototyping boards.

In this repository, I will post prototyping boards I developed for my embedded systems courses.

- [Arduino thermostat shield](/Ard_therm) : a shield used with Arduino mega to learn embedded programming.
- [Raspberry Pi Pico expansion board](/Pico_therm) : a board to plug a Pico and several peripherals.
